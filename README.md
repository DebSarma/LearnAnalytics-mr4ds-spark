## Course Materials

This workshop presents two days of training of Microsoft R for Data Science, and one day of Spark training. It is therefore meant to be presented in a three-day format.

In the first two days, you'll learn about using open source R and Microsoft R for data science workflows. In the third day, you'll take what you learned from open soruce R and scalable Microsoft R, and deploy it to a production-ready HDInsight Spark cluster.
